# GestProducts

## <a name="apresentation">Introduction</a>

GestProducts is a product inventory management project where users can create and associate products with categories. It includes authentication and authorization features to control access to endpoints.

## <a name="techsUsage">Technologies Used</a>

For this project I used the following technologies and why:

`React`: Library for building user interfaces.

`TailwindCSS`: CSS framework for styling.

`Axios`: Library for making HTTP requests.

`React Router`: Route management.

## <a name="routes">Routes</a>

- `/` : User login screen.
- `/register`: User registration screen.
- `/home` : User home screen.

## <a name="apiConfig">API Configuration</a>

Before we jump into basic usage, make sure the backend API is running and configured correctly. Update the API endpoint in the project if necessary.
